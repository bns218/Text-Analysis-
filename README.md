# Text-Analysis

#### **Project Overview**

This project involves extracting article text from URLs provided in an Excel file, performing text analysis to compute various textual variables, and saving the results in a structured format. The objective is to perform sentiment and readability analysis on the extracted text and output the results in a CSV or Excel file.

#### **Approach to the Solution**

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - **Libraries Used:** 
     - `pandas` for handling Excel files.
     - `requests` for making HTTP requests to fetch the webpage content.
     - `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing and extracting the article content from the HTML.
   - **Process:**
     - Read the input Excel file (`Input.xlsx`) using `pandas`.
     - For each URL, fetch the webpage content using the `requests` library.
     - Parse the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup` to extract the article's title and main text while avoiding headers, footers, and advertisements.
     - Save the extracted text into a `.txt` file named according to the `URL_ID`.

2. **Textual Analysis:**
   - **Libraries Used:**
     - `nltk` for text processing, including stop word removal and tokenization.
     - `re` for regular expressions to calculate personal pronouns and other text-based metrics.
   - **Process:**
     - **Sentiment Analysis:** 
       - Clean the text using a list of stop words.
       - Calculate Positive Score, Negative Score, Polarity Score, and Subjectivity Score using predefined dictionaries.
     - **Readability Analysis:** 
       - Calculate the Fog Index using average sentence length and percentage of complex words.
     - **Other Metrics:** 
       - Calculate word count, syllable count per word, complex word count, average word length, and other relevant variables as specified.

3. **Output Structure:**
   - The results are saved in an Excel file named `Output Data Structure.xlsx`, following the structure provided in the project guidelines.

#### **How to Run the `.py` File**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7+ is recommended).
   - Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 nltk openpyxl
     ```
   - You can find all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Running the Script:**
   - Place the `input.xlsx` file, `StopWords` folder, and `MasterDictionary` folder in the same directory as the Python script.
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python text_analysis.py
     ```
   - The script will read the URLs from `Input.xlsx`, extract the article text, perform the required analysis, and save the results in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.

3. **Expected Outputs:**
   - The extracted text files will be saved with the corresponding `URL_ID` as their filenames (e.g., `101.txt`).
   - The analysis results will be saved in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`, which can be opened in Excel or any other spreadsheet software.

#### **Dependencies**

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `nltk`, `openpyxl`
- Additional Resources: `StopWords` folder, `MasterDictionary` folder

#### **Additional Notes**

- Ensure that the script and all related files are in the same directory to avoid path issues.
- If you encounter encoding errors, the script handles them by writing text files in UTF-8 encoding.

This documentation will guide the user on how to set up the environment, run the script, and understand the output generated by the code.
•	python text_analysis.py
•	The script will read URLs from Input.xlsx, extract the corresponding article text, perform the required analysis, and save the results in Output Data Structure.xlsx.
3.	Expected Outputs:
•	The extracted text files will be saved with filenames corresponding to their URL_ID (e.g., 101.txt).
•	The analysis results will be saved in Output Data Structure.xlsx, ready to be opened in Excel or any other spreadsheet software.
Dependencies
•	Python: Version 3.7 or higher
•	Libraries: pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4, nltk, openpyxl
•	Additional Resources: StopWords folder, MasterDictionary folder
Additional Notes
•	Ensure that the script and all required files are in the same directory to avoid file path issues.
•	If you encounter encoding errors during text extraction, the script saves text files in UTF-8 encoding to handle them.
